# It's Football? Built on Expo
Mobile app for soccer fans living in the United States that want to know when to watch European soccer.

### Problem
- effort to find when soccer games are on in US timezones
- takes at least a google search to get score updates (and another search for international play, another search for womens soccer, and another search for la liga) to get score updates

### MVP Specs
- lists soccer games in order of nearest away in time (top of screen) to farthest away in time
- incorporate the main leagues in europe (premier league, la liga, bundesliga, serie A), international play (men’s and women’s: i.e., world cup qualifier)
- add user sign-in and authentication later
- on boarding that has a tutorial that shows the features

### Tech Specs
- cross-platform (so React Native) [ended up using Expo built on React Native]
- API used: football-data.org
